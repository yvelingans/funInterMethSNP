Description: Provides functional regression models framework to detect interaction effects 
    between DNA methylation profiles and SNP genotypes on continuous, binary, 
    or count outcomes. The methods rely on generalized additive models 
    implemented in the mgcv package and include tools to reconstruct 
    methylation curves, fit models, and test global SNP–methylation interactions.
